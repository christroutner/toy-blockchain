# Toy Blockchain

This is a 'toy' blockchain prototype. I'm building it to learn more about the fundamental data structure and how they work together. I was inspired by [this medium article](https://bluepnume.medium.com/building-bitcoin-in-javascript-1a82534765ec) where Daniel Brain built a simple 'bitcoin clone', written in JavaScript.
